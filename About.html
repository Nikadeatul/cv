    <p>Starting today, we will be asking for your date of
    birth when creating an account on Instagram. According to our
    Terms of Use, you must be at least 13 years old to have an
     account in most countries. Asking for this information will
      help prevent underage people from joining Instagram,
      help us keep young people safer and enable more age-appropriate
     experiences overall. Your birthday will not be visible to others
   on Instagram, but you’ll be able to see it when viewing your
    own private account information.<br>

If you’ve connected your Facebook account to your
Instagram account, we will add the date of birth that’s on your
 Facebook profile. This is not public information and only you
 will be able to see it when viewing your own account information
 on Instagram. Editing your date of birth on Facebook will also
  change it on Instagram. If you don’t have a Facebook account or
   if you have not connected your accounts,  you can add or edit
    your birthday directly on Instagram.</p>
